            <strong>* </strong><strong>University of Visvesvaraya College of Engineering (UVCE) was established in the year 1917 by 
            Sir M Visvesvaraya</strong>. Currently affiliated to Bangalore University, the College provides 
            six engineering courses – Electronics and Communication, Electrical and Electronics, Mechanical,
             Computer Science, Information Science and Civil Engineering.<br><br>
            <strong>*</strong><strong> Situated at KR Circle </strong>in a greenery filled scenic expanse of 10 acres, UVCE is in the neighborhood 
            of heavenly cubbon park and at an arm’s distance are some of the most important locations like 
            Vidhana Soudha, Karnataka High Court and City Civil Court. The City campus currently houses the Department
             of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Communication and Computer Science
             Engineering. Proximity to the Metro, City Bus Station and Railway Station connects one easily to any part
             of the city and helps in commutation to UVCE.<br><br>
            <strong>*</strong> Situated amidst Jnana Bharathi Campus spread over 50 acres, the hub of University Post graduate academic
             activities, the Engineering Campus has Departments of Civil Engineering and Architecture.<br><br>
            <strong>*</strong> This pioneer college has grown many folds, producing some of the best engineers in the country. 
            Being an institution that functions on only Merit- Based CET seat allotment, the students obtaining admission 
            are the creamy layer of the bright students in the state. The inexpensive fees structure is an aid and a 
            driving reason for students of difficult financial stability and from the rural to join the college. 
            The college crafts an environment for allround development of students encompassing both academic and 
            extra-curricular activities. The students are hardworking, cultured, highly disciplined and have preserved
             the cherished values of this institution over the years. UVCE instills a zealous essence into the students 
             which propels them to explore new realms of engineering and embark to achieve great things. Enhancing this 
             factor is the experience that students gain learning at UVCE in a way diff erent from the education system of 
             most conventional engineering colleges. Undermining the visible lack of infrastructure in UVCE is the vivacity 
             and learning that is meticulously propelled by the students themselves.<br><br>
            <strong>*</strong> The college is a hub of many technical and non- technical activities evenly spread throughout the year. 
            The ever active students are teamed to nurture various special interest groups in college to foster their 
            technical and creative skillsets on a myriad of platforms whilst helping each other. The entire student 
            fraternity contributes in making each of these events a success. The college is currently being funded by 
            the World Bank under the TEQIP project for the improvement of the quality of technical education through 
            various programs and infrastructural developments. The devoted faculty is highly qualified, experienced 
            and plays a pivotal role in enthusing the students to achieve remarkable feats. The Institution boasts of 
            very good campus placements and a mighty rate of students taking up higher education abroad.<br><br>
            * UVCE Alumni have etched <strong>“UVCE” </strong>as a highly recognized institution and are keeping the esteemed honor of the 
            institution flying high with their remarkable achievements in the respective fields/organizations. Alumni 
            of UVCE are not only noteworthy of their achievements that have brought great recognition to the institution 
            but have also made the nation proud on a global platform.<br><br>
